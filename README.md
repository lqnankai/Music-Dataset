Dataset SHTE_V1

Description: The items in this dataset come from the Sposobin's Harmony Textbook Exercises. This is the Version 1.0.

This dataset is derived from the exercise answers provided at the end of Chapters 1â€“19 of Sposobin. Each entry has been proofread by professional musicians. We manually entered each entry using Sibelius software to compile the final dataset.

The dataset contains several folders, each corresponding to a specific chapter. Within each chapter folder, there are two subfolders: "four" and "origin." 

The "four" folder contains entries that have been divided into four individual parts, while the "origin" folder contains entries split into two parts.
