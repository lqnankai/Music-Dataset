# Dataset SHTE_V1

This dataset is built based on the Sposobin's Harmony Textbook Exercises(SHTE). This is the Version 1.0.

## Description
This dataset is derived from the exercise answers provided at the end of Chapters 1â€“19 of Sposobin. Each entry has been proofread by professional musicians. We manually entered each entry using Sibelius software to compile the final dataset.

The dataset contains several folders, each corresponding to a specific chapter. Within each chapter folder, there are two subfolders: "four" and "origin." 

The "four" folder contains entries that have been divided into four individual parts, while the "origin" folder contains entries split into two parts.
